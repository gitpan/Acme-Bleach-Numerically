NAME
    Acme::Bleach::Numerically - Fit the whole world between 0 and 1

SYNOPSIS
      # To bleach your script numerically
      use Acme::Bleach::Numerically;
      print "Hello, world!\n";

      # Or do your own bleaching
      use Acme::Bleach::Numerically qw/num2str str2num/;
      my $world = str2num(qq{print "hello, world!\n";})

DESCRIPTION
    Georg Cantor has found that you can squeeze the whole world between zero
    and one. Many say he went insane because of that but the reality is, he
    just bleached himself with continuum hypothesis :)

    This module does just that -- map your whole world onto a single point
    between 0 and 1. Welcome to the Programming Continuum of Perl!

  EXPORT
    This module autobleaches when no argument is passed via "use". When you
    pass arguments, you can import "str2num" and "num2str" functions on
    demand.

BUGS
    This module is pretty slow when trying to bleach very large scripts.
